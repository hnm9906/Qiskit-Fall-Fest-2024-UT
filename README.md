# Qiskit-Fall-Fest-2024-UT
This is the Qiskit Fall Fest event for University of Tokyo. We're so exciting to have you all here. This event is being hosted by Purdue Quantum Intelligent Applications and Optimization (QIAO) Lab sponsored by IBM, Purdue Univeristy Fort Wayne Computer Science Department, Purude Fort Wayne ETCS, and National Science Foundation (NSF).

We are one of 50 campuses around the world and the only one in Indiana to host the IBM sponsored Qiskit Fall Fest Events.

The Qiskit Fall Fest is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from the entire IBM Quantum team. Student leaders work alongside IBM throughout the months of October to November to design and plan their event, which are then run in October. The events vary from technical hackathons to beginner-friendly challenges, all with the goal of helping to grow the local communityâ€™s skill set.

The Fall Fest here includes a series of workshops starting Oct 16 and ends with a hackathon, November 8 - 10. Details are coming.
